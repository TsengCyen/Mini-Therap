# Mini-Therap
<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
This application is a cut down version of Therap to what is going to be most commonly used by staff without permanantly removing everything in the worst case something goes wrong. A true app that'll be used to reshape the Therap website into however we desire.

Ideas:</br>
[X] Login Page Manipulation</br>
[X] Dashboard Page Manipulation</br>
[X] Pages should start cut-down rather than having to enable it first</br>
[X] Data Entry Manipulation</br>
[X] Custom Elements to define a set of options to select from form</br>
[X] Manually reset the page to original form when not hiding elements without refreshing</br>
[X] Check if user is an admin</br>
[] Scheduling Pages Manipulation (?)</br>
[] Customized-Look & Feel</br>
